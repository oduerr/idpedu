idpedu cleanup — Changeset

Scope: Tasks 0–3 completed.

What was added
- Workflow tests under `tests/testthat/test-workflows.R` covering:
  - Local → HTML (normalized snapshot)
  - Local → PDF (da.qmd)
  - Remote → PDF (stat.qmd)
- Test fixtures under `tests/testthat/fixtures/` and snapshot for normalized HTML.
- Test helpers:
  - `helper-skip.R` to skip when Quarto/TeX missing
  - `helper-artifacts.R` to persist latest outputs to `tests/artifacts/` (gitignored)
- `DESCRIPTION` updates: `Suggests: testthat (>= 3.0.0), pdftools`, `Config/testthat/edition: 3`.

What was changed
- No public API changes. `create_workbook()` remains the single exported function.
- Tests now generate human-inspection artifacts in `tests/artifacts/` and keep HTML snapshot stable via normalization.

What was removed
- Legacy Rmd/LaTeX pipeline and utilities not used by `create_workbook()` workflows:
  - `R/CreateArbeitsblatt.R` (createAB.old)
  - `R/CreateArbeitsblattMitBild.R` (createAB)
  - `R/MergeRMD.R` (mergeRMDFiles)
  - `R/MergeRMD_tolk.R` (mergeRMD2)
  - `R/PraktikumsUtils.R` (createAnkreuzBlatt, randomPick)

What will be deprecated/removed (future)
- Remaining legacy templates under `inst/rmarkdown/templates/aufgabe/**` if confirmed unused.

Notes
- All three canonical workflows produce expected outputs and are protected by tests.
- Next: Run coverage (covr), prune legacy with deprecations where appropriate, update this changeset accordingly.
